<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was developed as part of class CS408 at the University of Strathclyde 2022-2023. The world has changed
dramatically since the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people around the world feel more isolated from one another and social
activities are critical for our mental health. One of the social activities that has gained massively in popularity
since COVID-19 is hill walking. This project aimed to create a mobile application that provided hiking beginners with
the tools to become interested in hiking and to join the hiking community.
